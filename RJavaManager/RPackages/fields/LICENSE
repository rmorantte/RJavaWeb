NOTE:

The sparse matrix methods used in fields are supported by the package
spam and there are a subset of fortran routines in spam where some
licensing issues are unclear. Please refer to the spam license
information for details. Note that many functions in fields e.g. Tps,
Krig, all the graphical functions, do not require this package so much
of fields will be functional under a GPL license.
